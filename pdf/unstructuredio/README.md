# Unstructured.io PDF Extractor
This extractor uses [unstructured](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured) to extract data from both pdf and image files. Unstructured will extract text from key elements along with important metadata like page number and type.

### Output:
text/plain for each element found

### Input parameters
strategy: Literal['hi_res', 'fast', 'ocr_only', 'auto'] = "fast"
languages: Optional[Iterable[str]] = None

### Strategies
[Four strategies are available](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-api?tab=readme-ov-file#strategies) for processing PDF/Images files: hi_res, fast, ocr_only and auto. fast is the default strategy and works well for documents that do not have text embedded in images.

hi_res is the better choice for PDFs that may have text within embedded images, or for achieving greater precision of element types in the response JSON.

### Metadata:
[Metadata extracted](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/metadata.html) from unstructured also applied to the content.
