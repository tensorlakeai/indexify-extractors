# LLM Extractor

This is a LLM based Extractor that supports multiple LLMs. By default it uses OpenAI and works on the Content of previous extractor as message, however we can manually overwrite prompt and message.

### Example:
##### input:
```
prompt = """Extract information according to this schema and return json in this format {"Invoice No.": "", "Date": "", "Account Number": "", "Owner": "", "Property": "", "Address": "", "Registration Key": "", "Last Month Balance": "", "Current Amount Due": "", "Due Date": ""}:
